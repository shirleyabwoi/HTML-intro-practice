<h2> Day One</h2>
        <p>The reporting date for the codeHive 2025 cohort was 1st February 2025 by 8.00A.M.</p>
        <p><span> A requirement when reporting was students to come accompanied with parents.</span>
    <span>We were warmly welcomed and directed to confirm our details as they also took in our biometrics at the gate.</span>
    <p> Below is the image you will see as soon as you pass the campus gate; Below is the image you will see as soon as you pass the campus gate</p>
    <p> The warm welcome made it easy for all of us to navigate through the school. We did various activities on that day such as;
            <p>Orientation meeting </p>
            <p> Contract signing by parents</p>
            <p> Our introduction to the AkiraChix staff</p>
            <p> Shown various amenities such as our rooms and the toilets</p>
    </p>Saying goodbye to our parents and gurdians was the saddest part of the day.

<h2>Day Two; Sunday</h2>
<p> The second day had not so much going on. We were guided on rules that will be governing us. We did cleaning and got a chance to interact with the various parts of the school. We got to go to the classrooms and had a look at it. We were also handed laptops to be used for our classes.</p>
<h2> Monday-Friday</h2>
<p>At this point most of us were adopting to the new environment.Here is how the school's program runs on the weekday;</p>
<p><span> Breakfast by 6:20 A.M. </span>
<p><span> Cleaning our campus from 6;20 A.M - 7:00 A.M.</span>
<p><span> Attend class 7:00 A.M. - 12.00 P.M.</span>
<p><span> Lunchbreak 12:00 P.M. - 1:00 P.M.</span>
<p><span> Afternoon class 1;00 P.M. - 4:00 P.M.</span>
<p><span> Breaktime 4:00 P.M. - 5:00 P.M</span>
<p><span> Evening class 5:00 P.M - 8:00 P.M</span>
<p><span> Supper and eparting to the rooms from 8: 00 P.M. </span>
    <p> Basically the weekday involved being guided on the operations of the school. We got various trainers who mainly did introduction of the classes they will be teaching us. We got to be introduced to ways to use the laptop. Issues that laptops had were fixed.

    <h6> General Overview</h6>
    <p> AkiraChix is a nice place to be. The orientation they have makes it easier for new students. I enjoyed my onboarding week one into Akirachix Campus and look forward to going through the codeHive program.</p>
